### Demo

The demo for this course consists of two main parts: a front end
application and an API.

The demo API is hosted at
https://user-authentication-api-ocokqryugz.now.sh/api but you may also
pull it down and run it locally if you like. Please note that if you
do this, you'll need to have Mongo running locally as well. As an
alternative, you can sign up for an MLab account and provide your
credentials in a `.env` file. See the readme in the API repo for
further details.

The front end demos are offered in Angular 2, Angular 1.x, and
React. Pull down the repo that you would like to work with and follow
the instructions in the readme for how to install the dependencies and
run the app. Make sure the application runs for you before starting.
